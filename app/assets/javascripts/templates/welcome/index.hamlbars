%h1 Welcome to Goldengrove!

%p Goldengrove lets you interact with strangers in ways that can be by turns funny, creative, and profound. Get any Twitter user's last 30 tweets and use their words to construct a short poem (in the spirit of Twitter, no more than 140 characters). When your poem is complete, it will be shared to your Twitter with a mention to the user you sourced the words from.

%p If you're very creative (or lucky, or bawdy), you just might earn a special title in the Kingdom of Goldengrove for your efforts!

%p Click on the feather to begin your creative quest.
